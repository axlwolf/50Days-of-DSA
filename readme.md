### About the Course:

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Coding Interview Bootcamp with Javascript!

The primary goal of this course is to prepare you for coding interviews at top tech companies. By tackling one problem at a time and understanding its solution, you'll accumulate a variety of tools and techniques for conquering any coding interview.

### Daily Data Structures and Algorithms Coding Challenges:

The course is structured around daily coding challenges. Consistent practice will equip you with the skills required to ace coding interviews. For the next 50 days commit to yourself to practice atleast 2 coding interview questions everyday. You don't need any setup for this as the daily coding problem challenges can be solved in the coding environment provided by Udemy. The course will automatically track your progress and you just need to spend your time making actual progress everyday.

### Topics Covered:

We start from the basics with Big O analysis, then move on to very important algorithmic techniques such as Recursion, Backtracking and Dynamic Programming Patters. After this we move to cover common data structures, and discuss real problems asked in interviews at tech giants such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft.

For each question, we will:

* Discuss the optimal approach

* Explain time and space complexity

* Code the solution in Javascript (you can follow along in your preferred language)

## Additional Resources :

The course includes downloadable resources, motivational trackers, and cheat sheets.

## File Structure

Each folder includes:

- `readme.md` - The challenge/code instructions. This also includes hints, tests and a dropdown with the solution code as well as the explanation of the solution code.
- `[name].js` - This is your working file. It has the name of the function and the function is exported. No parameters are passed to the function. That is up to you to add.
- `[name]-run.js` - File to run the code manually. The function is already imported and called with expected parameters.
- `[name]-solution.js` The solution code with heavy commenting. Some challenges have multiple solutions. If you want the solution without comments, look in the `readme.md` file.
- `[name]-test.js` - Jest tests for the solution code. You will need to rename this file to `[name].test.js` to run the tests.

## Running Tests

In order for the Jest tests to run, you need to rename the test file to `[name].test.js`. For example, if you are working on the `hello-world` challenge, you need to rename the `hello-world-test.js` file to `hello-world.test.js`. This is because Jest looks for files with the `.test.js` extension.

Run the command `npm run test` from the root directory and it will run all the tests.

## These Don't Have to be "Challenges"

Some people, such as myself are not great at doing this stuff off the top of their head. Even though most of the code is setup as a challenge, you can certainly just follow along with the course and/or just study the solutions and learn from them.

You can use the tests to see if your code passes, but use the `run` files to run the code manually. This is so that you can experiment, console.log, etc.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run test` to run the tests. Again, you will need to rename the test files and replace the `-test` with `.test` to run the tests.
